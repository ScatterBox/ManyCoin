MANYoin
=======

Launch date: February 12th, 2014. 

History:  MANYoin was born as "Yet Another Cyber Coin".  We feel it was evolved into a new
star in the cyber coin universe.

Why generate Yet Another Cyber Coin?  Well, for starters, it was fun and a great way to learn
about the communities associated with cyber coins (aka crypto coins), not to mention all the 
technical and programming challenges that needed to be overcome (both fun and educational).  Along 
the way a great user community focused around the coin was born.

How are we different?  The development team is in this for the long run and are active members in
the altcoin community - helping select other altcoins succeed and working directly with pool and 
exchange operators as well as participating in altcoin industry forums.  We have faith the coin 
will grow, and the passion to make sure it does.  We have already been contacted by a couple of 
vendors wishing to use the coin, so we are encouraged it will be used for more than just exchanges.
Those involved with MANYoin today (developers and a core of dedicated supporters alike) are working 
on methods to use crypto-currencies in a manner in which it was intended: To allow the fast and 
efficient exchange and purchasing of goods and services without the need to use expensive third 
parties.

That is not all: By making full use of the MANYoin blockchain and network, the coin's technologies 
will also be used at an intrinsic level to provide a stable and sustainable method to improve 
gaming and other services deliverable via the internet and World Wide Web.

For MANYoin, sustainability and growth are the most important factors and will always remain so.

MANYoin! Mine today... spend tomorrow!

Key stats:

Project started in late January, 2014.  

1024 coin initial payout - since its a power of 2, it will halve nicely! 

2 year half life - get in early.  Besides... will anyone really be wanting to mine decades from now?

23.5 years of coin generation (yields roughly 100X the 84M Litecoin limit)

1.5 minute block time - should be a decent compromise

    Short form: Faster transaction, but no so fast that stale blocks become a huge problem 
    Long form: http://bitcoinmagazine.com/8972/quarkcoin-noble-intentions-wrong-approach/ 

25 hour block difficulty adjustment (every 1000 blocks)
    
Like Litecoin, MANYoin is scrypt based - a mild manored attempt at keeping it in mortal hands while still using commonly available mining tools.

Unlike Litecoin, MANYoin uses the Kimoto Gravity Well difficulty adjustment to provide some protection from difficulty surges.

Hard numbers:

8,437,616,148	Total coins in the pool

1.5 * 60 * 1000	TargetTimespan (e.g. 25 hours)

1.5 * 60	TargetSpacing (e.g. 90 seconds)

Ports:

Listen:   6333 (16333 for testnet)

JSON-RPC: 6332 (16332 for testnet)

Credits
--------

Obviously, primary credit has to go to the Bitcoin and Litecoin development teams without whome this project would never have been conceived of.  The wallet code was cloned from the 0.8.6.2 release of Litecoin.

And all the folks responsible for QT, MingW32, and the other tools used to build the Windows version of this.

Development of MANYoin was done using a Gentoo Linux environment.

Special thanks to the folks over at http://multicoin.zapto.org:8080/ for their support
